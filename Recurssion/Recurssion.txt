1. Recursion is a technique where a function calls itself to solve a smaller version of the same problem.
2. Two Main Parts of Recursion
   a. Base Case – Condition that stops the recursion.
   b. Recursive Case – The part where the function calls itself.
3. why to use recursion in DSA
  Recursion is very useful for:
   a.Solving divide-and-conquer problems
   b.Working with tree and graph structures
   c. Writing clean and short code for problems like: Factorial,Fibonacci ,Searching , Backtracking (e.g., N-Queens, Maze problems) ,Tower of Hanoi
