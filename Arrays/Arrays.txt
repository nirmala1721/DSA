Arrays in DSA

1. Definition: An array is a linear data structure that stores elements of the same type in contiguous memory locations. Each element is accessed using an index, starting from 0.

2. Importance of Arrays in DSA:
    - Fast indexing: Any element can be accessed in O(1) time.
    - Foundation for other data structures: Arrays are used to implement stacks, queues, heaps, etc.
    - Essential for solving various algorithmic problems.

3. Basic Array Operations:

| Operation | Description                               | Time Complexity      |
|-----------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| Access    | Retrieve element at a specific index      | O(1)                |
| Search    | Find an element (linear/binary search)    | O(n) / O(log n)     |
| Insertion | Add element (depends on position)         | O(n)                |
| Deletion  | Remove element (depends on position)      | O(n)                |
| Traversal | Visit each element                        | O(n)                |

4. Types of arrays 
  i.   One-dimensional array- Basic form of array
  ii.  Two-dimensional array (Matrix) - Useful in image processing, graphs, etc.
  iii. Multidimensional array- Rare in competitive programming
